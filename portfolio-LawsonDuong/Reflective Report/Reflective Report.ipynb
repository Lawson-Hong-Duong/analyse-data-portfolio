    "The first stage of data exploration was crucial in understanding the underlying structure and relationships within the dataset.In order to do this, the data had to be examined for trends, correlations and any outliers.Visualization is an important to performed as it provide a tangible representations of data patterns that help to solidified my understanding of the features of the dataset.I uses boxplot and pairplot as visualization for dataset breast cancer to observe the features more better.\n",
